# ETA: Learning Optical Flow with Efficient Temporal Attention
This repository contains the source code for our paper:
- ETA: Learning Optical Flow with Efficient Temporal Attention (IROS 2025)
  ![](./asset/attention.png)
  - [x] We introduce a novel idea of multi-frame information integration, which is a pioneering combination of multiframe settings and the attention mechanism. This combination optimizes the modelâ€™s inference speed under the multi-frame settings and improves performance on occlusions. 
  - [x] We suggest the concept of attention confidence, which allows the network to utilize attention information more efficiently. It is well-working, plug-and-play, and has wide applicability. 
  - [x] ETA, the first optical flow network with efficient temporal attention and the promising multi-frame method both on speed and accuracy, is proposed.
